## Test
```shell
$ stack test --fast
```

## Assumptions
1. The absence of a default means that there's no allocation for that category
1. ASCII encoded input

## Limitations
1. Due to rounding, a bill might fall short of funds even when a single
   district can fund it

## Improvements
1. Ensure that a bill is fully funded when possible, maybe by doing another round of allocation
1. Factor out `.Internal` modules to hide private names from the API,
   but sill making them available for testing
